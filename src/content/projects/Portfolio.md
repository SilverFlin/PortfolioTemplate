# Portfolio Website

## Project Experience

The integration of the stack of technologies that I used, i.e., VueJS, TS, and Tailwind CSS, made all the process smooth, I really enjoy how Vue makes you structure the code (if you are using the composition API), and the way that you could work with the tailwind classes are just delightful.

## Project Intention

The main intention of this is to showcase my projects to the public and to add an enjoyable element to the process of documenting how I achieved each one. This serves not only my future self but also for those who are interested in replicating similar projects. I have this idea of learning through application, I fell into the typical cycle of endless courses (as you could see on the about me / certifications section). However, I decided to stop this and instead start applying the technologies that I am learning. It is also way more fun.

## Project Challenges

At the start, some components were hard to imagine how I would make them, especially the carousel on the home view. I just tried to figure it out and applied it to see how it behaves. It worked exactly as I wanted! Yay! It still lacks responsiveness with mobile devices, which is something that will be addressed in the next version. I also want more feedback to prioritize all the changes and improvements to be made.

## Project Results

The page is now running, and I am really satisfied with the result, it was a great experience, I learned a lot. There's still some work to do, and that's exciting.
