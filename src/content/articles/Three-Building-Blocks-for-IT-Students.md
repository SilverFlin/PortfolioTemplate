I started my career knowing nothing about programming. I did have a passion for mathematics, and spending time around the computer was my day-to-day routine. Luckily, a friend of mine was working at the time in the IT industry. I approached him seeking direction, and it was one of the best decisions that I made.

While the mentoring was helpful, it was surely not enough, but the direction sent me through a journey of discovery to create a solid base upon which I will be building throughout my career, which I will give to you now.

## 1. You DO have plenty of time.

Have you said something like "Yeah, but I have no time for such and such"? All of us have said that at some point in our lives. We do not have the power to _truly_ control the time, but we can take advantage of each hour that we have each day.

One of the first pieces of advice that my mentor mentioned was to have a calendar. Not a physical one, though, but just using the calendar that came on your phone. It could be Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, or anything else that you rather prefer.

The idea behind having a Calendar is to be more aware of **how** you are spending your time. The strategy to start scaffolding your calendar doesn't matter (that much; having a calendar is truly game changing. 

I discovered that the strategy that I have used for the last 2 years is the same that came as a Highlight Tactic in the book Make Time: "Design Your day".

The approach that I take is to idealize my perfect week, I usually build this on a weekend, knowing how many weeks I have left for summer or in the semester.

This was my ideal week during summer classes, there is not that much after Innovation class, but you get the idea.


> Being this scheduled might sound annoying: "Where’s the freedom and spontaneity, man?" But in reality, a structured day creates freedom. *Make Time*

Having this structure has allowed me to create a balance between the university, extracurricular studies, and my personal life.

## 2. Your professors won't be there for you.

Your professors won't be there for you. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of professors that could have a big impact on your career, but you cannot expect to wait while their knowledge is passing into your head magically, you need to take action.

One of the things that made me ahead of some of my classmates were online courses. You must be aware of tutorial hell, but if you have no idea about something, a course could be really beneficial.

When I was in my first semester of Software Engineering, I started with a course of basic mathematics, discrete mathematics, another about Web Development (even without having web development-related classes, it was really helpful), and a heavy Java Course.

You could say that what you learn in class is enough, but believe me, it won't be enough. Maybe at the start, the professors will hold your hand throughout the process, but that won't last, and you need to start learning by yourself.

Doing the online courses allowed me to work with ease on each assignment, thus, giving me more time to prepare for the following classes or topics to learn.

Take courses, do extra projects, and learn how to read and navigate the documentation of the technologies that you are learning. That will put you ahead.




## 3. Take care of your sleep.

That first semester, I started to get obsessed with optimizing everything, and that also meant optimizing sleeping, searching for that physical and mental performance.
I reached the Huberman Lab Podcast while diving into YouTube. He is a professor of Neuroscience and ophthalmology at the Standford School of Medicine. His podcast made an incredibly positive change in my routine, and that was game changing.

We all know that sleeping is important, but do you know how you could optimize sleep?

I won't dig deep into this; I'll just give you some actionable items and advice that I learned from the podcast. If you want to know the whys, I recommend you give it a chance.

1. Be aware that quality != quantity sleep.
Most people aren't sleeping enough, and even that amount of sleep may not be of good quality.

2. Take control of the lights.
It is as easy as imagining that you do not have a ceiling, taking enough light in the morning, and dimming the lights before sleep. That will help you have a better quality of sleep.

3. Always sleep at the same time.
There could be some days that you will need to push some hours more, especially around finals, but try to avoid this as much as possible.

4. Avoid devices 1 hour before sleep.
That light will really impact your sleep, and the stimulus that you are receiving while scrolling is disrupting.

Those are some of the things that I learned and applied in my life from that podcast. I started feeling more energy and control over my life after these changes.

## Conclusion

As a student, you should take care of your environment. These three key lessons will help you do so, and they will give you the foundation that you need.

1. **Time management**: You are the owner of your time, take care of it and it'll change everything.

2. **Taking Initiative**: Do not wait for the knowledge to come, go there and seek it; it is your responsibility.

3. **Sleep well**: There's time to work, but there's also time to rest. Do not burn yourself out.
